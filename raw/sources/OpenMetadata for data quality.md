### User

I have a Data Platform based on the followind components:

- Dremio / Trino / Duckdb as Queery engines
- Data is stored in Iceberg tables and Parquet files
- dbt for managing the trasfomations and tests
- Kestra / Airflow for orchestration
- DataHub as a Data Catalog

I’m searching for a Data Quality Tool with the following requisites:

- Opensource
- Deployed on premises (no cloud)
- Integration with local llm for suggesting possible quality test
- A Dashboard to have an overview of the situation
- Alerting features (slack / email)

Please suggest some tool with the requested features

---

### Model

Based on your current stack (Dremio/Trino, Iceberg, dbt, DataHub) and your requirements for an **on-premise**, **open-source** tool with **Local LLM** integration, the best recommendation is **OpenMetadata**.

While you already use DataHub, **OpenMetadata** is currently ahead in providing out-of-the-box "AI Agent" features that work with local LLMs (via Ollama) to suggest quality tests.

Here is a detailed breakdown of the best options:

### 1. The "All-in-One" Solution: OpenMetadata
This is the closest match to your specific request for a tool that natively integrates local LLMs for suggestions and includes a dashboard.

*   **Why it fits:**
    *   **Local LLM Integration:** OpenMetadata has introduced an "AI Assistant" feature that supports **Ollama**. This allows you to run a model like Llama 3 or Mistral on-premise. It can scan your table schemas/metadata and suggest descriptions and data quality tests without data leaving your infrastructure.
    *   **Dashboard:** It has a dedicated **Data Quality & Profiling** tab. You can view test success/failure rates, history, and profile statistics (min, max, null counts) directly in the UI.
    *   **Execution Engine:** It natively connects to **Trino**, **Dremio**, and **DuckDB** to run these tests. You don't need a separate execution engine; it pushes the query computation to your existing engines.
    *   **Alerting:** Built-in alerts (Slack, Email, MS Teams) when tests fail.
*   **How it works with your stack:** You would connect OpenMetadata to Trino/Dremio. It scans the Iceberg tables, the local LLM (via Ollama) suggests "Column A should not be null" or "Column B values should be between 1-100", and you confirm these tests in the UI. OpenMetadata then schedules and runs them.

### 2. The "Build on What You Have" Solution: dbt + dbt-expectations + DataHub
Since you already have **dbt** and **DataHub**, you can achieve the same result without adding a massive new platform, though the "LLM suggestion" part requires a small custom workflow.

*   **The Tooling:**
    *   **Execution:** Use the **[dbt-expectations](https://hub.getdbt.com/calogica/dbt_expectations/latest/)** package. It allows you to write Great Expectations-style tests directly in your dbt YAML files (e.g., `expect_column_values_to_be_unique`).
    *   **Dashboard:** **DataHub** allows you to visualize dbt test results. You can configure the `datahub` dbt plugin to ingest test outcomes (Pass/Fail) so they appear in your DataHub catalog on the "Validation" or "Quality" tab of the dataset.
    *   **Local LLM Integration (The "Gap"):** There is no native "click-to-suggest" button in DataHub for this yet. You would create a simple Python script using a local LLM library (like `langchain` + `ollama`).
        *   *Script logic:* Read your dbt `schema.yml` $\rightarrow$ Send schema to Local LLM with prompt "Suggest data quality tests for dbt" $\rightarrow$ LLM outputs YAML snippets $\rightarrow$ You paste them into your dbt project.
*   **Pros:** deeply integrated into your existing transformation workflows.
*   **Cons:** The LLM part is manual or requires a custom script, whereas OpenMetadata has it in the UI.

### 3. The "Standard" Alternative: Great Expectations (GX)
If you want a dedicated testing framework separate from dbt.

*   **On-Premise:** Fully open-source and runs locally.
*   **Dashboard:** Generates **Data Docs**, which are static HTML websites hosting your test results. These are excellent but aren't a "live" dashboard unless you host the HTML files.
*   **LLM Integration:** GX has "interactive" features, but for local LLM suggestions, you would typically use their Python API to inject a custom "Profiler" that uses your local LLM to propose expectations.
*   **Note:** You can ingest GX results into DataHub to use DataHub as the dashboard.

### Summary Recommendation

| Feature | **OpenMetadata** (Recommended) | **dbt + DataHub** (Minimal Change) | **Great Expectations** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Test Engine** | Native (pushes to Trino/Dremio) | dbt (runs via Trino/Dremio) | Python/Pandas or SQL |
| **Local LLM** | **Native** (via Ollama integration) | Custom Script required | Custom Script required |
| **Dashboard** | **Built-in Interactive UI** | DataHub UI (via ingestion) | Static HTML (Data Docs) |
| **Alerting** | Native (Slack/Email) | Via dbt Cloud or Airflow/Kestra | Native (Slack/Email) |
| **Deployment** | Docker / Kubernetes (On-prem) | Existing Infrastructure | Docker / Python Package |

**My advice:**
Since you specifically asked for **integration with local LLM for suggesting tests** and a **dashboard**, **OpenMetadata** is the only tool that offers this package "out of the box" for on-premise deployment right now.

If you prefer to stick strictly to your current tools, I would recommend using **dbt-expectations** and writing a small utility script to have your local LLM generate the YAML config for you.

Are you sure Openmetadata has a Dremio connector?

### Model

Based on your specific constraints—especially the need for **Local LLM integration** and **On-premise** deployment—the best fit for your stack is **OpenMetadata**.

While most tools require you to send metadata to a cloud to get AI suggestions, OpenMetadata has built a native integration with **Ollama** that runs entirely on your infrastructure.

### Top Recommendation: OpenMetadata
OpenMetadata is an open-source "Data Catalog + Data Quality" platform. It fits your request because it treats Data Quality as a first-class citizen with a dedicated dashboard, not just a side feature.

*   **How it meets your needs:**
    *   **Local LLM Integration:** It has a built-in AI Assistant that connects to a local **Ollama** instance. It can scan your schema and suggest descriptions and **Data Quality Tests** (e.g., "ReviewCount should be between 0 and 5") without any data leaving your network.
    *   **Dashboard:** It provides a "Data Quality" tab for every table, showing test pass/fail history, profiling stats (nulls, min/max, distinct), and lineage.
    *   **Alerting:** Native integration with Slack, MS Teams, and Email for test failures.
    *   **Architecture:** Deploys via Docker/Kubernetes on-prem.

*   **Integration with your Stack:**
    *   **Trino & Iceberg:** It has native, production-grade connectors for both. Since your data is in Iceberg and queryable via Trino, OpenMetadata can profile your data effectively through these channels.
    *   **Dremio:** *Note:* OpenMetadata does **not** have a dedicated "Dremio" connector in its main release yet.
        *   *Workaround:* You can connect it to **Trino** to profile the underlying Iceberg data (recommended). Alternatively, you can use the OpenMetadata **Database Service (JDBC)** connector to connect to Dremio using Dremio's JDBC driver, though this is less "plug-and-play" than the Trino connector.
    *   **dbt:** It ingests your dbt `manifest.json` and `catalog.json` to populate lineage and descriptions automatically.

### Alternative: Soda Core + Custom Wrapper
If you prefer a lightweight CLI tool over a full platform, **Soda Core** is the industry standard for open-source data quality.

*   **Pros:** It has a working **Dremio** connector (via `soda-dremio`). It is excellent at running checks inside your orchestration pipeline (Kestra/Airflow).
*   **Cons:**
    *   **No Native Local LLM:** You would need to write a Python script that asks your Local LLM to "generate a SodaCL YAML file based on this schema," whereas OpenMetadata has this in the UI.
    *   **Dashboard:** Soda Core is CLI-only. The dashboard (Soda Cloud) is SaaS. To get an on-prem dashboard, you would have to ingest Soda's JSON output into DataHub or build a custom Grafana view.

### Summary Comparison

| Feature | **OpenMetadata** (Winner) | **Soda Core** | **dbt (dbt-expectations)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Local LLM** | **Native (Ollama)** | Manual / Custom Script | Manual / Custom Script |
| **Dashboard** | **Built-in UI** | Requires SaaS or Custom | DataHub (via ingestion) |
| **Dremio Support** | Via JDBC or Trino/Iceberg | **Native (`soda-dremio`)** | Native (via dbt adapter) |
| **Orchestration** | Kestra/Airflow triggers | Kestra/Airflow triggers | Runs within dbt |
| **Alerting** | Slack / Email / Teams | Slack / Email (CLI) | Via dbt/Orchestrator |

**My Advice:**
Deploy **OpenMetadata**. Connect it to **Ollama** for the AI requirements and to **Trino** to scan your Iceberg data. This gives you the dashboard, alerting, and "AI suggestions" out of the box while keeping everything on-prem.

### Model

For local data quality generation, you need a model that balances **SQL proficiency** (to write the tests) with **reasoning capabilities** (to understand *what* to test based on column names like "birth_date" vs "transaction_date").[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFWTWuOFrt5bWQp0vodxGqEYfPYO6QLD0RrNIBEQc7mona5NqHkLS0ScwCMHv8wqKqPgUtbuHeXuyzGsLBnw0aFHiqKomK-io1psfVGFFybQo8rBmrqylyirTXdiEbmuYaGJ0kE5FuEfx_qv5jgB8HoTATbDlde1McrAt1J1n7SPBTEA2ah5b1LoVxEkiTaNIadFtcehpOp2qejiuN5eyZQ_tk%3D)][[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFCAJRrTTniGuPfiz2EmO4c65bvKEn2Br3nMfjdN3TBuDA-evnEJcp6H_qr6p39in4MOEHd75hm8FJBv-d0R-dCZWH7KITQWRU3j0jI5NguajGcUHYeA09XYMKD_4AyRuoK7QBgQ98%3D)][[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHDIf16_UvMgLQzvSXW7rLOU0CYKHSW35ZTrL3ksGl17pXZ51AjSX6hQekwiAjtLDqkiv3erK1KOn-LiLKEwbhV_yToGGy-52ndSOA3hWpS-LCX4-0hw3pjMBwdHksW-ObU73IYUbSU-kIdCNthv2k2tUAmDWsJ423T0Vie3Mtvj698NBSjW-qI9wxKRhugLA6UK_pUlbyKFAx_p1ZIWFY%3D)]

Start with **Qwen 2.5 Coder (14B)** or **32B** depending on your hardware.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFWTWuOFrt5bWQp0vodxGqEYfPYO6QLD0RrNIBEQc7mona5NqHkLS0ScwCMHv8wqKqPgUtbuHeXuyzGsLBnw0aFHiqKomK-io1psfVGFFybQo8rBmrqylyirTXdiEbmuYaGJ0kE5FuEfx_qv5jgB8HoTATbDlde1McrAt1J1n7SPBTEA2ah5b1LoVxEkiTaNIadFtcehpOp2qejiuN5eyZQ_tk%3D)][[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFCAJRrTTniGuPfiz2EmO4c65bvKEn2Br3nMfjdN3TBuDA-evnEJcp6H_qr6p39in4MOEHd75hm8FJBv-d0R-dCZWH7KITQWRU3j0jI5NguajGcUHYeA09XYMKD_4AyRuoK7QBgQ98%3D)][[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHDIf16_UvMgLQzvSXW7rLOU0CYKHSW35ZTrL3ksGl17pXZ51AjSX6hQekwiAjtLDqkiv3erK1KOn-LiLKEwbhV_yToGGy-52ndSOA3hWpS-LCX4-0hw3pjMBwdHksW-ObU73IYUbSU-kIdCNthv2k2tUAmDWsJ423T0Vie3Mtvj698NBSjW-qI9wxKRhugLA6UK_pUlbyKFAx_p1ZIWFY%3D)][[4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFjqC75dh2vhkfrxPJ6MDvBnaXbdxaNKx0NU3Rl9BpDs-PZmFNFa3Gybn1jZUf6Rw0s4ZRbJ9cLOja8q51p3oMaUlXKBoX_cIt3vIT2WoZPIHbnGHpzoacPHrVIny4khOd-rPfEjIwo8FA6zHy4VPbigxdeOjmfrHfJfrJpt5ZMWnd7USqolZNW3-4S8z-7kX4NCEgXnE-FfZ1rLqLilgs%3D)]
It has the best balance of understanding "code logic" (required for writing SQL/dbt tests) and "schema reasoning" (understanding that a column named `email` needs a regex check).

### User

Is there any small model that can run on cpu?

---

### Model

Yes, absolutely. Running on a CPU is all about keeping the model size small (fewer "parameters") so it fits in your RAM and doesn't take 5 minutes to generate one sentence.

For your use case (reading a schema and suggesting tests), you need a model that is smart at **SQL/Code** but small enough to run fast.

Here are the best **CPU-friendly** models available on Ollama today.

### Top Recommendation: Qwen 2.5 Coder (3B)
This is currently the "pound-for-pound" champion for coding tasks on low-end hardware. It is specifically trained for code and SQL, making it surprisingly capable for its tiny size.

*   **Size:** ~2 GB RAM required.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHSOpZ1XTo9B0jf0GIsnde8uzKKtO3MG6cc2sQYTSB-M52SwGUFq8d0fFSHaJ4hxdJUbHf-Utt2oH6bh50IGyeRT1W2smqDDp_IAOnnnsgA3-meL43xmQxcycbtY5Iwf9YXtmAKr5Ybpp8ZaWYWcOaALVd7pc11THEkTNJUNZb4_lC_KHUHGL_JylQgEGrMdSVAGW9O8A%3D%3D)][[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFyRYXueurQQ63v84SmC7d9RU6M3OpbMKPZo539ygGfP8z1-1fzCAPGWIxEC3dj-A6XK7Wl7qvchOihsHJFjEFg8E2bC4pbnOjkjJ6lu9yZV6RFtvbmYD635UVMg8XpCzzvObqnWVBgMw%3D%3D)]
*   **Ollama Command:** `ollama run qwen2.5-coder:3b`
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Specialized:** It is fine-tuned for code, so it understands `CREATE TABLE` and data types better than general chat models of the same size.
    *   **Fast:** On a modern CPU (like an M1/M2/M3 Mac or decent Intel i5/i7), it feels almost instantaneous.
    *   **Context:** Supports decent context length, so you can paste a medium-sized schema without issue.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Reasoning Limits:** It might struggle with very complex business logic (e.g., "suggest a test that correlates revenue with tax laws in Italy") compared to larger models.

### Runner Up: Microsoft Phi-3.5 Mini (3.8B)
Microsoft designed this model specifically to punch above its weight class by training it on "textbook quality" data. It is widely considered the smartest "small" model for reasoning.

*   **Size:** ~2.5 GB RAM required.
*   **Ollama Command:** `ollama run phi3.5`
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Excellent at understanding instructions. If you ask it to "Suggest tests for columns that look like PII", it is very good at inferring context.
    *   **Context Window:** It has a massive **128k context window**, meaning you can feed it huge table schemas or even documentation files, and it won't "forget" the beginning.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **Less SQL Focus:** It is a generalist model. It writes good code, but Qwen Coder is slightly sharper on syntax.

### The Balanced Option: Llama 3.2 (3B)
Released by Meta specifically for edge devices (laptops, phones). It is a shrunk-down version of the powerful Llama 3.1.

*   **Size:** ~2.2 GB RAM required.[[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFyRYXueurQQ63v84SmC7d9RU6M3OpbMKPZo539ygGfP8z1-1fzCAPGWIxEC3dj-A6XK7Wl7qvchOihsHJFjEFg8E2bC4pbnOjkjJ6lu9yZV6RFtvbmYD635UVMg8XpCzzvObqnWVBgMw%3D%3D)]
*   **Ollama Command:** `ollama run llama3.2`
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Tool Use:** It is trained to be very good at using "tools" or formatting output as JSON, which is helpful if you want the suggested tests in a specific format to copy-paste into dbt/Soda.
    *   **Ecosystem:** Because it's Llama, it works with almost every prompt template out there.
*   **Cons:**
    *   In pure coding benchmarks, it often trails slightly behind Qwen Coder.[[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQHOSLkuc-1J4v2llrBApQ8P2h-d3HOSYIfJBQkuuxCcAX8haJv6EM8tranPOggbHvRo_zSotvR3LRcg6lnpxYsL8tHEVuDiN1P_Kh16evkeezphLP2G8fnDRpL5KPwJE_8Jw0aYcIRe8Wlv9KHL75zHx-qts4_iM8i8mnh5_W224u78VvdcxpTxBaPo32U9yGI%3D)]

### The "Ultra-Light" Option: Gemma 2 (2B)
If you are running on a very old server or a machine with **< 4GB of RAM**, this is your best bet. It comes from Google DeepMind.[[4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFKEwRIqNd8WVspuJs5va1gvvyGrAt2M4K0KZo-sNJEVCGfJblhIbj-l0iSEDOfHky90ok-U2r6raFW9KGrK7u8RJkzLscF_qXcxxtumO7Fg7rRLEuKNsJ95hjA1oKPyOcjAhXWcNA%3D)]

*   **Size:** ~1.5 GB RAM required.
*   **Ollama Command:** `ollama run gemma2:2b`
*   **Pros:**
    *   **Extremely Fast:** It will fly even on older CPUs.
    *   **Lightweight:** You can run this alongside your other services (Dremio, Docker) without it choking the server.
*   **Cons:**
    *   **"Dumb":** At 2B parameters, it hallucinates more often. It might suggest a test for a column that doesn't exist if the schema is too complex.

### User

what about DBRX?

---

### Model

**DBRX** (by Databricks) is essentially the "final boss" of open-source models.

It is an incredible model, but it is **completely different** from the "small CPU" models we just discussed. It is massive, resource-hungry, and likely **impossible to run** on your standard on-premise infrastructure unless you have a dedicated AI super-server.

Here is the breakdown of why DBRX is likely **not** the right fit for a standard local Data Platform setup:

### 1. The Hardware Barrier
DBRX is a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** model with **132 Billion** parameters.[[1](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQEtU5HgbL3SX-WJVuyyplfBG3_CllW62SfqLqNZeOGjN72vFbLfwoX3MLZU8SlgpcGLTZSrQD9uPG3dxawwVLbAmM906Nr5Hli6yAJbdgi7-flR9fI7lPkkuPf-FsL1PjodLQqkKj1XE_qJWjTr-mRmnxyYhODX_KSxDIO7MYU5xQ8j)][[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQGAyHKuQf250OFuef9c1mdAUpg19mTlT1_nFkPkqCoIeBxTnM2LgdWEHsOu55voTUtcc6__-H2LiGmXS_4EJiJ_yjT1jhmBePgcG98eaabyGKKrD8ytkCu3_XOfTxs5UxfxheYSXF0%3D)][[3](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQH--aMbFIOIdvaztk1_cxsUQua5DBsGOIKo9txgj5kGvO2pd9tOjYJyIcSnTAeBI4gLQbG-uKSojHzapv2hGjO91dF2LMk5mTe0QfV6vgeUj-_gbizMYErN3prJqhqf6JOoyzcei8WL32M_HG_pC9dgo573996KzsbCFe4fvA629otqHWUWQRKUwsIMBH7SBwww7lZQsSX2xvXO)][[4](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQGxN_YB354B8KBFvY6tK9awx-hdL44SaharEmBqfAlXlVdYpe_sojyeEDTH_KqmDcy4vNoUCVOZz0wlztPc6P8Cw5m5_Fj3FcN6zNWnesetA8FPh9n0brt8N7Evx2_A3TqY29a27zadI6G9774Xmg%3D%3D)][[5](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQGZhUajwayWBp4eCSh2wh6-MBtDbqNXL8n3trdz7JQLtgCPoGBsMCIf6d_PyiGJL4TS7jje74Zn-9_PxLiofHf8oqG9oYIyuTGCEx_9yY98xjP6IEBE-essmYh1hTXL1j24fpt-6QHPwWHo1dz33RpUHGcBgT6Z6TxpRaeuHc_BqP_pQkiRVfpIqBrTb1KOf98HPGPN1XgklINcZ6a3SdtdX7mHMDookeIbvkRJcc7EVcpG)][[6](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQFlIAua-8lQ0yLtaZoLQBjges74qn3Jp1XvdlKT-7r7hdGxcXSpnpaeICHIHOUPM1Q9DwKEl0kzJhbYGN1ybeWCMlJaH48gy2sfJqHEcAYSADT6a4n_7gcRW8G2dbBR3QA%3D)] Even though it is efficient (it only uses 36B active parameters per token), it still needs to load all 132B weights into memory.

*   **To run it normally (FP16):** You need **~320 GB of VRAM**. (This requires roughly 4x Nvidia A100 80GB GPUs linked together).[[7](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQE0vNK4Zy3kvkFbWVVsHSwtIYfUQqu1PITPudqBMfb-Fcg3dE28JOQ6PI8sBHgFJs7qYWFtLumFteVBzY2bFZYVkS_QWQn-ZPT7vZaXvDfm9bnoGjNLrFym7rebvZM%3D)]
*   **To run it compressed (4-bit quantization):** You need **~90 GB of VRAM/RAM**.
    *   *Can it run on CPU?* Theoretically yes, if you have a server with 128GB+ of system RAM. However, it will be **painfully slow** (0.5 to 1 token per second). It would take minutes to generate a single test case.

### 2. It is "Older" (In AI Years)
DBRX was released in **March 2024**.[[2](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQGAyHKuQf250OFuef9c1mdAUpg19mTlT1_nFkPkqCoIeBxTnM2LgdWEHsOu55voTUtcc6__-H2LiGmXS_4EJiJ_yjT1jhmBePgcG98eaabyGKKrD8ytkCu3_XOfTxs5UxfxheYSXF0%3D)][[8](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQEHMP4ucnn69_S8tqro3yGgSpNWwCu-bQ3bGykToxq9QSE6UB2ANN4ltE3c25ISLJ158lJ_-XWfIXG5SjPwNyXzJfg8NtRdBl2DPZyRbSwm69kwyh78god4lXtRDncEBD-Wt3zTaaVqyQ%3D%3D)] In the fast-moving AI world, that is a long time ago.
*   **Qwen 2.5 (released late 2024)** and **Llama 3.1** have effectively made DBRX obsolete for most users.
*   **Benchmark Reality:** The **Qwen 2.5 32B** model (which fits on a single consumer GPU or runs decently on a CPU with 32GB RAM) often matches or outperforms DBRX in coding and SQL tasks, despite being **4x smaller**.

### 3. Pros & Cons Summary

| **Hardware Needed** | 4x Enterprise GPUs (or 128GB RAM Mac Studio) | 1x Consumer GPU (24GB VRAM) or 64GB System RAM |
| **Speed** | Slow (unless on massive cluster) | Fast |
| **Coding Skill** | Excellent (State-of-the-Art in early 2024) | Excellent (Matches DBRX with less hardware) |[[9](https://www.google.com/url?sa=E&q=https%3A%2F%2Fvertexaisearch.cloud.google.com%2Fgrounding-api-redirect%2FAUZIYQESFmo8LF-lpJu3LgSvWsu7CLOe9J4Wrj9EhZg2q9FC9OPeaSysopN5XXTr-Uq1Io54yuA_cNuX1YvN_Syx05ldxipS5UCOXB1L_s5FbwZwccecGuzCzmwo33bkKFxlhpbhlc3dQQEZ06p7UPltkVXNno_cMrLBwivNanBktQQEKbPlj5I%3D)]

### Verdict
**Do not use DBRX** for your local Data Platform unless you already own a GPU cluster with \$100,000+ worth of hardware.

**Stick to Qwen 2.5 Coder (32B)**. It gives you 95% of DBRX's intelligence but runs on a standard server you likely already have.

### Model

If you are looking at server-grade deployment (e.g., you have a cluster of A100/H100s or are using an API provider) and want to compare **DBRX** against the other heavyweights like **Llama 3.1 70B**, **Qwen 2.5 72B**, and **DeepSeek**, the landscape changes.

**The short answer:** DBRX was the king of open-source coding models for about two months (March–May 2024). Today, it has been surpassed by **Qwen 2.5** and **Llama 3.1**.

Here is how DBRX stacks up against the current "Big Model" leaders for Data Engineering tasks.

### 1. The Direct Competitor: DBRX vs. Qwen 2.5 (72B)
**Qwen 2.5 (72B)** is the current gold standard for open-source coding and SQL.

*   **Architecture:**
    *   *DBRX:* Mixture-of-Experts (132B params total, 36B active).
    *   *Qwen 2.5:* Dense model (72B params).
*   **Comparison:**
    *   **SQL & Code:** Qwen 2.5 significantly outperforms DBRX on coding benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, Spider). Qwen is widely considered to be close to GPT-4o / Claude 3.5 Sonnet level for pure coding.
    *   **Context Window:** Qwen supports up to **128k** tokens. DBRX is natively **32k**. For large schema analysis, Qwen wins.
    *   **Language Support:** Qwen is multilingual; DBRX is heavily English-focused.
*   **Verdict:** **Qwen 2.5 Wins.** If your goal is generating complex SQL queries or dbt tests, Qwen 2.5 72B is "smarter" and understands nuance better than DBRX.

### 2. The Generalist: DBRX vs. Llama 3.1 (70B)
**Llama 3.1 70B** is the industry standard "workhorse."

*   **Comparison:**
    *   **Reasoning:** Llama 3.1 is better at "following instructions" and general reasoning. If you ask it to "Explain *why* this data quality test failed in a business context," Llama usually gives a more coherent answer.
    *   **Ecosystem:** Llama is supported everywhere. DBRX requires specific loader optimizations because of its unique MoE architecture.
    *   **Knowledge Cutoff:** Llama 3.1 is fresher.
*   **Verdict:** **Llama 3.1 70B Wins on General Reasoning.** It generates better documentation and descriptions. However, for pure SQL syntax, it trades blows with DBRX (with Qwen beating them both).

### 3. The Architecture Rival: DBRX vs. Mixtral 8x22B
Both DBRX and Mixtral are **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** models.

*   **Comparison:**
    *   **Performance:** DBRX generally beats the older Mixtral 8x7B, but trades blows with the newer **Mixtral 8x22B**.
    *   **Specialization:** DBRX was trained by Databricks specifically on coding and technical data. It often writes better Spark/Databricks-specific code than Mixtral.
*   **Verdict:** **Tie / Context Dependent.** DBRX is still very strong if your stack is explicitly Databricks (Spark SQL, Unity Catalog), as its training data heavily favored that ecosystem.

### 4. The "Godzilla": Llama 3.1 (405B)
If you have infinite compute (e.g., 8x H100s), Llama 405B is in a different league entirely. It rivals GPT-4o. DBRX cannot compete here.

---

### Why you might still choose DBRX
Despite being older, DBRX has one specific niche where it shines: **Databricks Specifics.**

If your platform uses **Delta Lake, Spark SQL, and Unity Catalog** heavily, DBRX has "muscle memory" for this syntax that generic models sometimes miss. It knows the difference between a standard SQL `MERGE` and a Delta Lake `MERGE` intimately because it was trained by the company that built it.

### Final Ranking for "Big" Open Models (Data Eng Focus)

1.  **Qwen 2.5 (72B):** The current king of open-source coding. Best for writing complex SQL checks and dbt tests.
2.  **Llama 3.1 (70B):** The safest choice. Excellent all-rounder, great at writing descriptions and business logic.
3.  **DeepSeek V3:** (Just released) Highly efficient and rivals Qwen in coding, but more complex to deploy.
4.  **DBRX:** Excellent for Spark/Databricks stacks, but slightly behind the curve on general reasoning and pure Python proficiency compared to the newer models above.

**Recommendation:**
If you are deploying a large model to power your Data Quality platform, deploy **Qwen 2.5 72B**. It gives you the highest "SQL IQ" available in the open market today.
