## What is Presidio

Presidio *(Origin from Latin praesidium ‘protection, garrison’)* helps to ensure sensitive data is properly managed and governed. It provides fast ***identification*** and ***anonymization*** modules for private entities in text such as credit card numbers, names, locations, social security numbers, bitcoin wallets, US phone numbers, financial data and more.

### Goals

- Allow organizations to preserve privacy in a simpler way by democratizing de-identification technologies and introducing transparency in decisions.
- Embrace extensibility and customizability to a specific business need.
- Facilitate both fully automated and semi-automated PII de-identification flows on multiple platforms.

### Main features

1. **Predefined** or **custom PII recognizers** leveraging *Named Entity Recognition*, *regular expressions*, *rule based logic* and *checksum* with relevant context in multiple languages.
2. Options for connecting to external PII detection models.
3. Multiple usage options, **from Python or PySpark workloads through Docker to Kubernetes**.
4. **Customizability** in PII identification and de-identification.
5. Module for **redacting PII text in images** (standard image types and DICOM medical images).

⚠️ Presidio can help identify sensitive/PII data in un/structured text. However, because it is using automated detection mechanisms, there is no guarantee that Presidio will find all sensitive information. Consequently, additional systems and protections should be employed.
